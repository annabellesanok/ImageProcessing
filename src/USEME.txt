To use our GUI:

- To start a new project, use the button that says New Project. You will then be prompted to
enter a name for your project, and then a height and width. These must be words for the name
and numbers for height and width.

- To load a project, press the Load Project button and use the file chooser to select a file
where you have previously saved a collage project. Rendering a loaded project in our GUI isn't
working, but all the functionality is working properly, and this command can be properly executed
in the text view mode. 

- To add an image to a Layer, press that button while editng the layer you'd like to add it to
and use the file chooser to pick what image to add. Then you will be prompted to enter an x and y
position for this image on the layer. The image will be displayed and to see the entire project,
you can select a filter. The user can add jpgs, pngs, and ppms.

- To save an image, press the Save Image button while editing the layer with the image you want to
save. Then use the file chooser to choose where to save and input the name that the image
should be saved as and then press save.

- Save project can be done by pressing that button and then again picking a name and location
for the project to be saved as using the file chooser that comes up.

- To leave the program, either use the exit button or the X in the top right corner.

- To add a layer, press that button and input the name of the new layer.

- To select which layer to view or work on, use the buttons that are labeled with each layer
name and click which is desired.

- To set a filter, use the filter buttons and select one to add to the layer you are currently on.

- The image can be viewed in the image panel.




 To use the text-view version of our program:

 - To start a new project, use the command: new-project name height width, where height and
 width are integers representing the height and width of the project

 - To load a project, use the command: load-project projectPath, where the file to be loaded has to
 be a previously-saved project file

 - To add a layer, use the command: add-layer name, where you can add a layer of that name to the
 current project

 - To add an image, use the command: add-image-to-layer layerName imagePath xposn yposn, where the
 layerName is the layer that you want to add the image to, the imagePath is the path of the image
 you want to add -- can be either a jpeg, png, or ppm image, and the x and y posn are ints
 representing the location of the image on the project, where x=0 and y=0 means that the top left
 corner of the image will be placed in the top left corner of the project

 - To set a filter, use the command: set-filter layername filtername, to set the layer of the
 provided name to the provided filter. The filters that this program supports are brighten-intensity,
 darken-intensity, darken-luma, brighten-luma, brighten-value, darken-value, red-component,
 green-component, blue-component, multiply, screen, difference, and normal

 - To save an image, use the command: save-image imagename.ppm layername, where you can save
 the image on the specified layer as the type of image that was initially loaded (a jpg, ppm, or png)
 under a chosen name

 - To save a project, use the command: save-project projectname, where you can enter a name to
 save your project under.

 - To leave the program, use the command "quit" at any point, and the program will be terminated
